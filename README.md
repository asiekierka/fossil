## Fossil

### Introduction

**Fossil** is a modpack by asie centered around being fully open and free to modify and fork by all of its users. It accomplishes this goal in a few ways:

* Using MCUpdater and an easy-to-use pack generation system,
* Using only open-source mods (with permissions to use, modify, redistribute originals and modified copies).

On top of that, we'd love to make it a fun pack to play on!

### Generation/Forking

1. Fork the repository.
2. Edit config.json to configure your version of the pack.
2. Run

        $ npm install
        $ node fossil
    
4. Upload the "output/web" folder to the folder you configured in config.json *and/or* send us a pull request!

### Support

All bug reports, crashlogs and issues when running the modpack should be opened in this repository's issues.

### Licensing

All mods are copyright (c) by their respective authors and licensed under their respective licenses.

The configuration files are put under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0. The Fossil generator is placed under the same license as the AsieLauncher, being in part a derivative of its server code. MCUpdater is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0.

We encourage you to modify the modpack to suit your specific needs.
